# push_swap
Because Swap_push isn’t as natural.

Summary:
In this project i will make a program that sorts data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed i’ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.
